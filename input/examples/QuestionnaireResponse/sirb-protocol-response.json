If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. To help assess, the following guidelines are used. Related  The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that the study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study agent and the AE. Not Related There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.{Alternative text}For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE's causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. Definitely Related There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. Probably Related There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrentdisease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. Possibly Related There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant's clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as 'possibly related' soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to 'probably related' or'definitely related,' as appropriate. Unlikely to be related A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whosetemporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., theevent did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and inwhich other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., theparticipant's clinical condition,other concomitant treatments). Not Related The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidenceexists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative,definitive etiology documented by the clinician."}
