If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. To help assess, the following guidelines are used. Related  The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that the study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study agent and the AE. Not Related There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.{Alternative text}For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE's causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. Definitely Related There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. Probably Related There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrentdisease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. Possibly Related There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant's clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as 'possibly related' soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to 'probably related' or'definitely related,' as appropriate. Unlikely to be related A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whosetemporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., theevent did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and inwhich other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., theparticipant's clinical condition,other concomitant treatments). Not Related The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidenceexists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative,definitive etiology documented by the clinician."}

Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician's assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event.

UPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study.Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode.The PI will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduledvisit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject's personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study."}

In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use allinformation collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.

At the end of the study, all study databases will be de-identified and archived at the NYU Langone Medical Center.{Additional text for Certificate of Confidentiality}To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the NIH. This certificate protects identifiable research information from forced disclosure. It allows the investigator and others who have access to research records to refuse to disclose identifying information on research participation in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level. By protecting researchers and institutions from being compelled to disclose information that would identify research participants, Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the research objectives and promote participation in studies by helping assure confidentiality and privacy to participants.{Additional text for NIH Data Sharing Policy for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)}This study is a genome-wide association study and will comply with the NIH Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted GWAS, whichcalls for investigators funded by the NIH for GWAS to 1) share de-identified genetic (genotypic and phenotypic) data through a centralized NIH data repository; and 2) submit documentation that describes how the institutions have considered the interests of the research participants, such as privacy and confidentiality. Submission of data to the NIH GWAS repository will be consistent with the permissions and limitations delineated on the study consent signed by study participants."}
