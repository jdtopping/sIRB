  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>Launching a multi-site clinical study is frequently a long and involved process that can delay the development of potentially effective clinical treatment. Ethics review and approval processes conducted by IRBs have been cited as a major contributor to delays in initiating multi-site studies. The set of federal regulations for human-subjects research was revised with a requirement that a single IRB be named when multiple sites are using the same protocol. These standards are intended to facilitate transmission and coordination of key documents between the single IRB and the relying sites.</p>
