The trial includes a Run-in Period (if stable conventional treatment needed), a 4-week Screening Period, a 12-week Treatment Period, and a 3-week Safety Follow-up Period to Day 105. 90 patients will be centrally, dynamically, randomly assigned to 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive 600mg TJ301 biweekly (Q2W), 300mg TJ301 Q2W or placebo Q2W. TJ301 or placebo administrations will occur on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Randomisation will be stratified by prior corticosteroids treatment (yes/no) and consent to participate in PK substudy (yes/no). During the treatment period and the follow-up period, patients should be on stable conventional treatment for UC in double-blind except for those who cannot tolerate the stable conventional treatment. Conventional treatment for UC can be the concomitant UC treatment or UC treatment previously received by the patient, including corticosteroids at no more than 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent), and/or with medications containing 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), and/or with azathioprine (AZA)/mercaptopurine (6-MP). Study Flowchart There will be 9~10 main visits at the investigational site during the study: - Visit 0: Run-in period: at an optional visit (Visit 0), decision will be made if patients need stable conventional UC treatment to meet the following criteria: with corticosteroids stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Randomization at no more than 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent), and/or with medications containing 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) at no less than 2 g 5-ASA per day for at least 3 months and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Randomization, and/or with azathioprine (AZA) at no less than 1.5 mg/kg/day or mercaptopurine (6-MP) at no less than 0.75 mg/kg/day for at least 6 months and stable for at least 6 weeks prior to Randomization. If patients already met the criteria, they will directly enter the Screening Period (Visit 1). If not, they will need stable conventional UC treatment during the Run-in Period except those who cannot tolerate the medications mentioned above. - Visit 1: Screening Visit, start of Screening Period (Days -28 to -1 prior to Visit 2) - Visit 2: Randomisation Visit (Baseline), start of 12-week Treatment Period - Visits 3-7: 5 visits during 12-week Treatment Period - Visit 8: End of Treatment (EoT) Visit, completion of 12-week Treatment Period - Visit 9: Safety Follow-up Visit, scheduled at 35 days after the last dose of IMP (Day 105). Clinical assessments of disease activity will take place at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2 (Randomisation Visit), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8), Visit 7 (Week 10), and Visit 8 (Week 12). During Screening and at Visit 8 (Week 12), assessments of disease activity will also include endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy); mucosal biopsies for assessment of mucosal healing, histology, immunohistochemistry will be collected during endoscopy at these time points. TJ301 PK will be assessed in a subgroup of patients in Mainland China (24 patients, 8 per arm; electronically assigned at randomisation and consenting to the extra procedures). Blood samples for PK subgroup will be collected as follows: · At 1st dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 6), and 240 (Day 10) h after the start of the 1st administration; · At the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th administrations blood samples will be collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion; · At 6th dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 76), 240 (Day 80), 336 (Day 84), 480 (Day 90), and 840 h (Day 105) after the start of the 6th administration. The actual sampling time will be recorded. For patients completing the last dose of IMP, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled to Day 105 (Week 15). For patients not completing the trial, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled 35 days (5.8 - 6.6 half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose of IMP."

Data Analyses Quantitative variables will be described with the number of non-missing values, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and minimum/maximum values. Qualitative variables will be described with the number and percentage of patients with each qualitative characteristic. Missing values will not be included in the calculation of percentages. All data will be listed by individual patient and study visit. The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical and endoscopic remission at Week 12. This binary outcome (remission status=yes/no) variable will be analysed by a logistic regression model. A patient with missing data on the remission status will be assumed to be not in remission. All dichotomised secondary endpoints will be analysed using a repeated logistic regression model and continuous endpoints will be analysed using a repeated measures Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. In addition, patients in both the placebo and the treatment groups will be split into subgroups based on the baseline level of IL-6/sIL-6R complexes. Comparison in endpoints will be made for different subgroups. Safety analyses will be summarized descriptively by treatment groups. No statistical testing for comparison of treatment groups will be performed for safety variables. The PK parameters will be derived using non compartmental method. The PK of TJ301 will be summarized using descriptive statistics."

									"valueString": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, e.g. in response to infection and tissue damage. IL-6 is believed to be a key mediator in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; i.e. Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis [UC]). IL-6 exerts its multiple biological activities through two main signalling pathways. One is the socalled classic ligand-receptor pathway via membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) present mainly on hepatocytes and certain leukocytes. The second is the trans-signalling pathway via circulating soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) originating from proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound IL 6R or from alternative splicing (1)(2). While the classic IL-6 signalling is involved in the acute inflammatory response, trans-signalling is mainly involved in chronic inflammation and has been shown to prevent disease-promoting mucosal T-cell populations from going into apoptosis. A schematic presentation of the trans-signalling pathway of IL-6 is shown in Figure 1. TACE: tumour necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme ADAM: A disintegrin and metalloprotease Figure 1 Trans-signalling Pathway of IL-6 Patients with Crohnâ€™s disease and UC have been found to produce increased levels of IL-6 when compared with controls, the IL-6 levels being correlated to clinical activity (3)(4)(5)(6). Crohnâ€™s disease and UC patients have also been found to have increased levels of sIL-6R and consequently, IL 6/sIL-6R complex in serum (4)(5)(6). TJ301 (FE 999301, Olamkicept (proposed INN)) is a first-in-class, selective IL-6 trans-signalling inhibitor and anti-inflammatory biologic that is under development for the treatment of UC and Crohnâ€™s disease. TJ301 is a selective IL-6/sIL-6R complex trap consisting of two complete extracellular domains of gp130, the common signal transducer of IL-6-type cytokines, dimerised by fusion to the fragment crystallisable region (Fc region) of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). TJ301 targets and neutralises the IL-6/sIL-6R complex thereby inhibiting the trans-signalling pathway, without any interaction with either IL-6 or IL-6R individually, which is different from other anti-IL6 or anti-IL6R products in development to block IL-6 two signaling pathways. TJ301 is expected to be as effective as existing biologics but safer and more suited for early and long-term use."

These studies showed dose-proportional systemic exposure, in the dose range of 0.75 mg to 750 mg, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 5 days and no apparent dose-dependent trends in the incidence or nature of adverse events. Furthermore, a cohort of patients with quiescent Crohnâ€™s disease demonstrated similar systemic exposure to that in healthy subjects, for corresponding doses of 75 mg, 300 mg, and 750 mg in the single-ascending-dose trial. The purpose of this proof-of-concept trial is to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of two different doses of i.v. infusions of TJ301 in patients with active UC. The ability to induce remission of TJ301 will be investigated in the 12-week double-blind treatment period of the study."

									"valueString": "For patients with active UC, 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) is considered a first-line treatment, either as oral or topical (e.g. suppositories, enema) formulations. 5-ASA has a benign safety profile with dosing in active disease of up to several grams a day, but is not effective in all patients. Oral, systemic corticosteroids are used for induction of remission in patients not responding to 5-ASA. Corticosteroids have frequent and occasionally serious side effects, e.g. hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis suppression, hyperglycaemia/insulin resistance, cataracts, and osteoporosis (notably, IBD itself is a risk factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis, with Crohnâ€™s patients being most affected), and systemic corticosteroids are therefore undesirable in maintenance treatment. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) (i.e. thiopurines), are used as steroid-sparing agents in steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory patients, in induction as well as maintenance treatment (7)(8), but are associated with an increased risk for malignancies (9). Since thiopurines and corticosteroids are not effective in all patients and especially in the moderately to severely active IBD patient population, there is a need for novel, effective and safe second- and even third-line treatment options. In conclusion, patients with active UC are representative of the target population for TJ301, and should present the opportunity to detect a larger effect due to more pronounced disease activity at Baseline."

							"valueString": "This is a multicenter, stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study.\nThe trial includes a Run-in Period (if stable conventional treatment needed), a 4-week Screening\nPeriod, a 12-week double-blind Treatment Period, and a Safety Follow-up Period of 3 weeks to\nDay 105.\n90 patients will be centrally, dynamically, randomly assigned to 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive 600mg\nTJ301 biweekly (Q2W), 300mg TJ301 Q2W or placebo Q2W. Randomisation will be stratified by\nprior corticosteroids treatment (yes/no) and consent to participate in PK substudy (yes/no). TJ301\nor placebo administrations will occur on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70.\nDuring the double-blind period and the follow-up period, patients should be on stable conventional\ntreatment for UC.\nThere will be 9 ~ 10 main visits at the investigational site during the study:\n• Visit 0: Run-in Period: at an optional visit (Visit 0), decision will be made if patients need\nstable conventional UC treatment to meet the following criteria: with corticosteroids stable\nfor at least 2 weeks prior to Randomization at no more than 20 mg prednisone (or\nequivalent), and/or with medications containing 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) at no less than\n2 g 5-ASA per day for at least 3 months and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to\nRandomization, and/or with azathioprine (AZA) at no less than 1.5 mg/kg/day or\nmercaptopurine (6-MP) at no less than 0.75 mg/kg/day for at least 6 months and stable for at\nleast 6 weeks prior to Randomization. If patients already met the criteria, they will directly\nenter the Screening Period (Visit 1). If not, they will need stable conventional UC treatment\nduring the Run-in Period except those who cannot tolerate the medications mentioned above.\n• Visit 1: Screening Visit, start of Screening Period (Days -28 to -1 prior to Visit 2)\n• Visit 2: Randomisation Visit (Baseline), start of 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period\n• Visits 3-7: 5 visits during 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period\n• Visit 8: End of Treatment (EoT) Visit, completion of 12-week Double-blind Treatment\nPeriod\n• Visit 9: Safety Follow-up Visit, scheduled at 35 days after the last dose of IMP (Day 105).\nClinical assessments of disease activity will take place at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2\n(Randomisation Visit), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8),\nVisit 7 (Week 10), and Visit 8 (Week 12). During Screening and at Visit 8 (Week 12), assessments\nof disease activity will also include endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy); mucosal biopsies\nfor assessment of mucosal healing, histology, immunohistochemistry will be collected during\nendoscopy at these time points.\nTJ301 PK will be assessed in a subgroup of patients in Mainland China (24 patients, 8 per arm;\nelectronically assigned at randomisation and consenting to the extra procedures). Blood samples for\nPK subgroup will be collected in as follows:\n• At 1st dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 6), and 240 (Day 10) h\nafter the start of the 1st administration;\n• At the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th administrations blood samples will be collected pre-dose and at\nthe end of infusion;\n• At 6th dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 76), 240 (Day 80), 336\n(Day 84), 480 (Day 90), and 840 h (Day 105) after the start of the 6th administration.\nThe actual sampling time will be recorded.\nThe schedule of blood sampling for PK assessment allows the evaluation of PK profiles after single\ndose and after multiple doses in patients with UC. Considering the terminal plasma half-life of 5.3 –\n6.0 days for TJ301 in healthy volunteers, the last blood sample will be collected at 840 hours\n(5.8~6.6 half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose. Also due to the long half-life of TJ301, the\nscheduled sparse blood sampling would be able to capture the PK profile of TJ301.\nIn order to ensure that standard therapy is not withheld from patients not gaining sufficiently from\nIMP treatment, patients suffering a worsening in disease after Visit 5 are to be withdrawn.\nWorsening will be defined as an increase from last visit in Mayo rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, over\n3 consecutive days (Appendix 1). Such worsening should be evaluated by the Investigator and\nconfirmed by endoscopy (no improvement or worse) prior to deciding whether or not to withdraw\nthe patient.\nFor patients not completing the trial, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled 35 days (5.8 - 6.6\nhalf-lives of TJ301) after the last dose of IMP. For patients completing the 12-week Treatment\nPeriod, likewise a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled at 35 days after the last dose of IMP\n(Days 105)."

					"answer": [
						{
							"valueString": "This trial is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial of\nTJ301. Patients will be on concomitant treatment with stable doses of corticosteroids, or\nimmunomodulators, or 5-ASA/sulfasalazine – all first- or second-line standard of care in UC – for\nat least the duration of the 12-week Treatment Period (i.e. up to the primary endpoint). Two dose\nlevels of TJ301 will be investigated, and as discussed in Section 3.4.4, modelling of the effect on a\nPD biomarker, based on PK measurements over a wide range of serum concentrations of TJ301,\nsuggests that the chosen dosages may show a dose-dependent clinical efficacy.\nThe typical duration of induction treatment in active UC, both in clinical practice and in clinical\ntrials, is at least 8 weeks. The novel mechanism of action with TJ301, with blockade of only IL-6\ntrans-signalling, may influence the time to a clinically relevant endpoint such as clinical remission.\nIn order to capture the full extent of the potential treatment effect, the primary endpoint will be\nassessed at Week 12. As shown in the recent proof-of-concept trial with etrolizumab (10) in a similar trial population as the one proposed with TJ301, placebo response was higher earlier during\nthe treatment course (at Week 6 as opposed to Week 10). Thus, more substantive ‘true’ response\nand remission rates can be expected with longer treatment duration."
