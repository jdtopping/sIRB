### Background
Launching a multi-site clinical study is frequently a long and involved process that can delay the development of potentially effective clinical treatment. Ethics review and approval processes conducted by IRBs have been cited as a major contributor to delays in initiating multi-site studies. In response, the set of federal regulations for human-subjects research (Common Rule, 45 CFR Part 46.114) was revised with a requirement that a single IRB be named when multiple sites are using the same protocol. Rather than each site waiting for approval of a study by its local IRB before enrolling subjects, a single IRB review will expedite approval and improve the timeline for study completion.  Researchers have frequently commented about redundancy of effort, additional costs, and administrative burdens that often lead to delays and imbalances in enrollment of research participants in multi-site clinical studies.  The burden of existing manual work at multiple clinical investigational sites can also adversely impact site data quality and sustainability.

### Significance
In lieu of ad hoc transfers of PDFs and other document formats via email, this project utilizes FHIR based standards to facilitate document exchange. A standards enabled process leveraged by software has the potential to significantly decrease the extensive manual tasks that have become associated with using a single IRB system. This use of FHIR standards to meet the need for an efficient exchange of data and documents will improve the operational efficiency and human subject protection intended by the mandated policy.  

### Coverage
At this time, this Implementation guide only covers the Determination Letter, Protocol and Consent templates.  These will be expanded with the completion of other templates associated with this project.

### Dependencies
These standards were developed based upon the [R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/) FHIR version.
